# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project involves the detection of fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning algorithms. The system uses a rule-based algorithm to gather initial user information and generate the foundational data. This is followed by the application of generative AI to enhance the data further. For the detection of fraud, a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm is employed due to its speed and suitability for continuous models.

To mitigate the common drawback of overfitting associated with Decision Trees, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the data.
